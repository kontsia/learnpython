lists exxample: colors=["red","blue"]
sets example: colors={"red","blue"}
tuples example: colors=("red","blue")
ranges example: age=range(21,60)
dictionaries example: {"John":"Sales","Maria":"Legal"."Lara":"HR"}



list can have duplicate values, sets DON'T!
if you have a list and you want to remove the duplicates --> revert it into sets!!!

tuples is immutable lists. It is useful to protect some data against unwanted changes!

ranges is useful for quickly generated small or large sequences of integer within certain bounds

dictionaries is useful for databases entries of data
