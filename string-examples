# Python uses indexes to mark the position of an element (ie string character), within a sequence of elements.
# A string is a sequence of elements and the elements of a string are the characters themselves!
# The first element of any sequence, when counting from left to right, has the index 0.
# Then the second element of the sequence has the index 1.
# So, when using indexes, remember to always start counting from 0.
# When counting backwards, from right to left, the first index will be -1.

# So, the last character in a string will have index -1

# Indexes are enclosed by square brackets, when we want to access some letter of a string.
# Let's see this in practice:

mystring[0]
'T'


mystring[10]
' '

mystring[1]
'h'


mystring[11]
'f'


mystring[9]
'y'


mystring[-1]
'g'

#To find out the lenght of the string (or the numbers of the string characters):
len(mystring)
23
